## Automating Infrastructure Deployment on AWS 
### Description 
+ Automate the deployment of infrastructure on AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IAC) principles. Create a sample application stack using AWS CloudFormation, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs. Your objective is to demonstrate your ability to automate the deployment of a multi-tier application stack and configure it to run on AWS. 
+ Tasks: 
1. Create an AWS CloudFormation template that provisions a VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, and EC2 instances.
2. Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to deploy the CloudFormation stack in an AWS region of your choice.
3. Configure the EC2 instances to run a sample web application using any programming language and framework of your choice.
4. Use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to update the CloudFormation stack with the sample web application code.
5. Test the sample application to ensure it's working correctly and meets the requirements.
Deliverables: 
1. CloudFormation template code.
2. AWS CLI or AWS SDKs code used to deploy the CloudFormation stack.
3. Source code for the sample web application.
4. A brief report summarizing your approach to the challenge, the challenges faced, and the solutions implemented.
Evaluation Criteria: 
1. Ability to create a CloudFormation template that meets the specified requirements. 2. Proficiency in deploying a CloudFormation stack using AWS CLI or AWS SDKs.
3. Ability to configure EC2 instances to run a sample web application using any programming language and framework of your choice.
4. Ability to use AWS CLI or AWS SDKs to update the CloudFormation stack with the sample web application code.
5. Quality of the sample web application code and the ability to test it.
6. Quality and clarity of the report submitted.
This challenge will help AWS Cloud Engineers to demonstrate their skills in automating infrastructure deployment on AWS using IAC principles. By completing this challenge, engineers will learn how to provision, deploy, and configure a multi-tier application stack on AWS, gaining valuable experience in managing AWS resources using code.
